<h3>
Abstract</h3>
<p>Changes in thin-film transistor (TFT) characteristics can cause non-uniform brightness in OLED displays, and external compensation circuits cannot address such changes if they occur rapidly. 
  Our system acquires a short segment of the source voltage curve of the TFT driving each pixel, during the vertical blanking interval. 
  It then estimates the threshold voltage \(V_{\text{th}}\) and the mobility-related parameter \(k\) of that TFT, using neural networks and recurrent conditional learning to perform expectation-maximization. 
  Finally, it corrects the pixel brightness accordingly. The average errors in the estimated \(V_{\text{th}}\) and \(k\) are respectively 1.6mV and \(\text{3.7x10}^\text{-11}\text{F}/\text{V}\text{s}\), 
  and we demonstrate the visual effect of compensating with these estimates.</p>
-->
  
<h3>
Implementation of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm </h3>
<p>Recurrent conditional (RC) learning can be viewed as a form of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. 
  If the observed values \(V_{\text{s}}\) are \(\mathsf{V}\), and the hidden variables \(\mathsf{K}\) and \(\mathsf{H}\) correspond to \(k\) and \(V_{\text{th}}\) respectively, the likelihood function is given as follows:
  </p> 
 $$\begin{align} 
    L(\theta,\phi;\mathsf{V}) = p(\mathsf{V}|\theta,\phi) = \sum_{k,h}p(\mathsf{V}, \mathsf{K}, \mathsf{H}|\theta, \phi).
   \end{align}$$
  
<p>Since \(\mathsf{K}\) and \(\mathsf{H}\) are independent, we can divide above equation into two likelihood functions as follows: 
  </p>
 
 $$\begin{align}
L_k(\theta;\mathsf{V})&=\sum_{k}p(\mathsf{V},\mathsf{K}|\mathsf{H}, \theta)p(\mathsf{H}), \text{for fixed } \phi, \\
L_h(\phi;\mathsf{V})&=\sum_{h}p(\mathsf{V},\mathsf{H}|\mathsf{K}, \phi)p(\mathsf{K}), \text{for fixed } \theta .
\end{align}$$
<p>The EM algorithm attempts to maximize the marginal likelihood using an iteration in which two steps are repeated. 
  In the E-step, the previous parameter values \(\theta^{t-1}\) and \(\phi^{t-1}\) are used to determine the expectation of log-likelihood for the new \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) values, as follows:
</p>
$$\begin{align}
Q(\theta|\theta^{t-1}) = \Bbb{E}_{\mathsf{K}|\mathsf{V},\mathsf{H}^{t-1},\theta^{t-1}}\text{log}L_k(\theta;\mathsf{V}),
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align}
Q(\phi|\phi^{t-1}) = \Bbb{E}_{\mathsf{H}|\mathsf{V},\mathsf{K}^{t-1},\phi^{t-1}}\text{log}L_h(\phi;\mathsf{V}).
  \end{align}$$

<p>Since \(\text{log}[p(\mathsf{H})]\) and \(\text{log}[p(\mathsf{K})]\) are log-probability density functions established by \(\phi^{t-1}\) and \(\theta^{t-1}\) during the previous iteration, 
  they do not affect optimization of the \(Q\)-functions. Thus, the main purpose of the E-step is to infer \(p(\mathsf{K},\mathsf{V}|\mathsf{H}^{t-1},\theta^{t-1})\) and \(p(\mathsf{H},\mathsf{V}|\mathsf{K}^{t-1},\phi^{t-1})\). 
  In the M-step, new values of \(\theta^t\) and \(\phi^t\) are obtained which maximize the expectation \(Q\),
  </p>
  
$$\begin{align} 
\theta^{t} = \text{argmax}_{\theta}Q(\theta|\theta^{t-1}),
\end{align}$$
$$\begin{align} 
\phi^{t} = \text{argmax}_{\phi}Q(\phi|\phi^{t-1}).
\end{align}$$
  
<p>The implementation of this mutual EM algorithm that runs on the RCTCN iteratively optimizes these parameters.
  </p>

Visual Simulation</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Visual simulation flow</strong>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Data flow in our simulation of compensation for non-uniform OLED brightness, using solid-tone and photographic images. The blue region shows the simulation blocks, and the pink region the compensation blocks.  </figcaption>
</figure>
  
<p>
<br>
Figure 1 shows the flow of data in the simulation and compensation processes. Simulation begins with the generation of maps of non-uniformity of \(k\) and \(V_{\text{th}}\).
The simulator receives an RGB image, and then linearlizes the gamma to obtain luminance. This is normalized to the maximum luminance and used to generate \(V_{\text{gs}}\). 
The purpose of the block labeled Vgs-to-Ids in Figure 1 is to determine the current \(I_{\text{ds}}\) that flows through a TFT from the applied voltage \(V_{\text{gs}}\). 
The LUT selector block builds a look-up table from measured Vgs-to-Ids data on the \(k\) and \(V_{\text{th}}\) from non-uniformity maps. 
This allows the lookup table to include realistic fluctuations in the relationship between \(V_{\text{gs}}\) and \(I_{\text{ds}}\).
</p> 
  
<ul>
  <li><strong>A model of non-uniform brightness in OLED displays</strong>
</ul>
 
<p>
Since the way in which TFT characteristics vary is established, realistic pixel non-uniformity can be simulated from the measured process variation.
Figure 2 shows how we can combine both of large- and small-scale spatial non-uniformity maps with a displayed image.
By reference to the curve that relates OLED current to light emission, we can obtain a modified image which shows the resulting variations in brightness as shown in Figure 4 and 5.

<h3>
Parameter tuning</h3>

  <p>Several of the hyper-parameters for our scheme have to be found experimentally. 
    First, we considered the time interval used in sampling the \(V_{\text{s}}\) curve. 
    We sampled 10 values of \(V_{\text{s}}\) using 7 different sampling times (\(\text{T}_{\text{sample}}\)), from 0.2ms to 1.4ms and used the resulting samples to train the RCTCN. 
    Figure 3 (a) shows that the error decreases from 0.4ms to 1.0ms and then flattens out. 
    We therefore consider 1.0ms to be the minimum acceptable sampling time.
    The number \(N\) of \(V_{\text{s}}\) samples has significant implications for the speed of the ADC required in the external compensation circuit. 
    We trained the RCTCN with different numbers of samples between 4 and 14 taken over a period of 1.0ms, and report the error-rate in Figure 3 (b). 
    The lowest error-rate is associated with 10 samples, but the error-rate is not much different with 6 samples, which would yield a more cost-effective implementation.
    We also studied the effect of the number of iteration \(T\) on the recurrent learning process. We trained RCTCN over 2 to 20 iterations, for 10 samples taken over 1.0ms.
    As shown in Figure 3 (c), the error-rate steadily decreases until 12 iterations, then it flattens out, so we use 12 iterations for training.
    Finally, we also need to consider the number of iterations required at inference time, which has a greater impact on hardware requirements than the number of iterations at training time.
    We experimented with between 1 and 10 iterations. Happily, the results shown in Figure 3 (d) suggest that only 4 iterations are needed at inference time.
    We attribute this to the way in which the networks are forced to minimize the losses at the early iteration in our recurrent training setting.</p>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
Version control tools like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> are great for developing, sharing, and documenting code. Why not for science, too? Consider the following workflow:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discover or invent something.</strong> This is supposed to be the hard part. For me, this invariably involves writing wild and wooly exploratory Python code, which goes in a private Github repository, if I'm behaving myself.</li>
<li><strong>Collect results into intelligible figures.</strong> I usually do this via Python code, which also belongs in a private Github repository.</li>
<li><strong>Write explanatory text.</strong> I've always found this step is a mess. No set of tools I've tried (e.g. Word, LaTeX, Google Docs) fit my workflow (e.g. collaboration, version control, formatting). An HTML/CSS template with math typesetting, code syntax highlighting, and automatic reference listing (via Javascript) fits me perfectly - and allows collaborative writing via a private Github repo!</li>
<li><strong>Circulate preprints.</strong> Existing options like email, arXiv, or bioR\(\chi\)iv are great, but it's 2016 - why are we using PDFs? The web makes sharing data, code, animations, and interactive figures straightforward. If the code, data, and HTML are already on Github, then sharing a preprint is as simple as <a href="https://pages.github.com/">activating Github Pages</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Submit for peer review.</strong> Historically, a huge mess. Much has been written about the <a href="http://www.ascb.org/2016/11/07/on-publishing-and-the-sneetches-a-wake-up-call-november-december-2016-newsletter/">unfortunate state of academic publishing</a>. Why not cut out the middleman and solicit review directly from qualified colleagues? (A much longer discussion, and beyond the scope of this document - but I want to try it.)</li>
<li><strong>Archive for posterity.</strong> I want my work to exist after I die, in an open, available and <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/">citable</a> form. Github, Github Pages, and <a href="https://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> address these problems cleanly (although there's room for improvement).</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been careful about dependencies; Git and Github are helpful, but not required. You can download a <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGYork/publication_template/zipball/master"><code>.zip</code> of this repository</a>, edit <code>index.html</code> with a text editor, and view the results with a web browser. I avoid Javascript which loads via the web, so you can work offline. My figure generation code depends on the <a href="https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html">Scipy stack</a>, but this is easy to swap out; all you have to do is generate static images, put them in the proper folder, and link to them from <code>index.html</code>. You can generate your static images using any tool you choose. If you happen to use code to generate your figures, though, great! You can put this code in the <code>figure_generation</code> directory, enabling version control and simple reproduction of your results by others.</p>

<p>Writing directly in HTML/CSS/Javascript isn't for everyone. It's fiddly, has a learning curve, and requires obsessive attention to detail. In my experience, writing a scientific publication already fits this description, so it's a small price to pay, and one I'm already paying.</p>

<h3>
Math typesetting</h3>

<p>I use MathJax for typesetting. I want to be able to work offline, but a local MathJax copy is huge, so I followed the recipe described by <a href="https://tiborsimon.io/articles/web/minimal-mathjax/">Tibor Simon</a> to make a minimal version. The recipe's pretty cool; you delete most of MathJax, try to load it, watch your browser console, and copy files back one at a time until your browser stops complaining. I only support LaTex input; if you want more, you can follow Tibor's recipe and replace the contents of <code>/javascript/Minimal-MathJax/</code>.</p>

<p>Examples of paragraph equations:</p>
<div>
    $$\begin{equation}\prod_{\substack{1\le i \le n\\ 1\le j \le m}}M_{i,j} \end{equation}$$
    $$\begin{equation}L' = {L}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\end{equation} $$
    $$\begin{align} B'&=-\nabla \times E,\\E'&=\nabla \times B - 4\pi j,\end{align} $$
    $$\begin{equation}x = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + a_4}}}\end{equation} $$
</div>

Example of inline math: \(\frac{a^3}{b}\)

<h3>
Code syntax highlighting</h3>

<p><a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a> makes HTML syntax highlighting easy. I only included Python highlighting; if you want more, download a freshly customized version from <a href="http://prismjs.com/">prismjs.com</a> and replace <code>/javascript/python-highlighting/prims.js</code>.</p>

<p>Example Python syntax highlighting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import antigravity
antigravity.fly()
print("Whee!")
</code></pre>

<h3>
Automatic reference list</h3>

<p>An example of how to include a citation:

[<a class="citation" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1004526" title="Asymmetric Division and Differential Gene Expression during a Bacterial Developmental Program Requires DivIVA; Prahathees Eswaramoorthy, Peter W. Winter, Peter Wawrzusin, Andrew G. York, Hari Shroff, Kumaran S. Ramamurthi; PLoS Genet 10 (8), e1004526">Eswaramoorthy2014</a>].

If you inspect the HTML, you'll see that inserting the citation is super clumsy, but at least you don't have to keep track of uniqueness, ordering, etc.</p>

<h3>
Static and interactive figures</h3>

<p>Version control isn't a great way to organize images, but you can get away with it if there aren't too many, and they don't change too often. Figure 1 uses an image stored in the local repository.</p>

<figure id="Figure_1">
<img src="./images/figure_1/period_000002.svg"
 alt="Figure 1" id="Figure_1_image">
<figcaption><strong>Figure 1: A static figure using a local image.</strong> This image was generated by <code>/figure_generation/figure_1.py</code>.  </figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p> Figure 2 is interactive; the images are pre-computed (by Python code, in this case) and stored in the local repository. Simple javascript changes the figure's <code>img.src</code> when the figure's <code>select</code> changes. The images are small and don't change much, so it's not horrible to store them in this repository. A similar figure with substantially more images would stretch the limits of this approach. </p>

<figure id="Figure_2">
<img src="./images/figure_2/period_000004.svg"

    </tr>
</table>
<figcaption><strong>Figure 2: An interactive figure using local images.</strong> This figure's images were pre-generated by <code>/figure_generation/figure_2.py</code>, and switched dynamically by <code>/javascript/update_figures.js</code>. </figcaption>
</figure><p></p>

<p>Interactive figures can potentially contain huge numbers of images, which are clumsy to store in a version-controlled repository. My current preferred solution is to store such images in an auxiliary location. During the writing process, we generate these images automatically using the figure generation code and store them locally. Once the paper is ready to publish, we host a copy of these images in a second auxiliary repository. The figure update Javascript finds the appropriate image source for us.</p>
